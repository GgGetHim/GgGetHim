Heyy, I'm Ibo.

I am currently learning on full-stack engineering on Codecademy. My interests, other than full-stack engineering include machine learning, game developement
and ethical hacking too. 

I am not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment but will say so, when I want to. 

For anyone who wants to reach me you can do so via my e-mail: aksuibrahim@yahoo.com.

Thanks for reading! :]
